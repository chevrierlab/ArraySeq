# ArraySeq

Processing and analysis of spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by Array-seq.
The Array-seq cature area size, makes it well-suited for multiple replicates, and high throughput experiments. The ArraySeq package is therefore equipt with functionalities for handling:
- Single tissue sections
  - Note: Each tissue section on a slide does not necessarily require a seperate sequencing index, so long an individal tissue section is present in the input H&E image. 
- Multiples tissue sections
- Serial sections for 3D spatial transcriptomics
  - Sections spacing up to 100 Âµm have been validated.
